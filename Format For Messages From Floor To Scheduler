	Byte Array of 7 bytes
	
	1st byte = Hour request was made
	2nd byte = Minute request was made
	3rd byte = Second request was made
	4th byte = Millisecond request was made
	5th byte = Floor where request was made
	6th byte = Direction user wants to travel (0 = Down, 1 = Up)
	7th byte = Floor where user wants to travel
